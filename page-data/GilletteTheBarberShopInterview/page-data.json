HR departments haven't evolved along with time. This archaic recruiting methods are inefficient because it almost always impedes candidates from presenting themselves at their best. we are going to install special chairs in barbershops where job seekers can receive a free makeover. These men will not only be undergoing a makeover, but unwittingly also participating in a job interview. Barbers will \"interview\" their clients in a laid back and informal manner. The \"customers\" will be candidates who failed at previous job interviews. On the other side of the mirror, a hidden camera will transmit the interview to the HR professionals who turned away the candidates at the previous interview.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/portfolio/assets/barbermain.png\" alt=\"barberMain\" title=\"barber main\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 29, 2020","path":"/GilletteTheBarberShopInterview","title":"Gillette: The Barber ShopInterview","thumbnail":"","metaDescription":"barberShop"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
